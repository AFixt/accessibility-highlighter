## Testing Approach

1. **One Test at a Time**: Work through tasks sequentially, completing each fully before moving to the next
2. **Incremental Coverage**: Run coverage after each test to track progress  
3. **Function-Level Focus**: Test individual functions comprehensively before moving to the next
4. **Mock Properly**: Use Jest mocks for Chrome APIs and DOM manipulation
5. **Verify Fixes**: Run full test suite after each addition to ensure no regressions
