# Accessibility Highlighter

The Accessibility Highlighter finds accessibility problems on a website and highlights them on the page to give a visual indication of what the problems are. It also logs errors to console.

## How to use this

This is a browser extension. However, it is not installable via Chrome Webstore. It must be installed as an unpacked extension. See instructions for how to do so:

Once the extension is installed, click on the icon in the browser to enable the extension. When the extension is enabled, the highlighting will occur automatically on every page you view. To turn off the highlighting, click the icon again. This will put it into a `disabled` state and turn off the highlighting. Continuing to click the icon will continue to toggle this behavior.

NOTE: Enabling the extension also means that the websites will probably be inaccessible to you, especially because of the way that the highlighting works.  As a result, you'll want to enable & disable the extension according to when you need it.

## Caveats

This extension's goal is simply to provide a visual demonstration of accessibility problems. It isn't meant as an auditing tool. It doesn't find all accessibility errors, and there might be false positives. Any discussion related to what this does/ does not do should be viewed in that context.
