# a11y-highlighter

The a11y-highlighter finds accessibility problems on a website and highlights them on the page to give a visual indication of what the problems are.

## How to use this

This is a browser extension. However, it is not installable via Chrome Webstore. It must be installed as an unpacked extension. See instructions for how to do so:

Once the extension is installed, the highlighting will occur automatically on every page you view. NOTE: That also means that the websites will probably be inaccessible to you, especially because of the way that the highlighting works.  As a result, you'll want to enable & disable the extension according to when you need it.

## Caveats

None of this should be considered production-ready code. It is only for demonstrating accessibility problems. This means that the code doesn't perform quickly, it doesn't find all accessibility errors, and there might be false positives. Any discussion related to what this does/ does not do should be viewed in that context.
